Casbin provides two approaches for implementing data-level permission filtering: querying implicit assignments or using batch enforcement.

### 1. Querying Implicit Roles and Permissions

When users inherit roles or permissions through an RBAC hierarchy rather than through direct policy assignments, these are called "implicit" assignments. To retrieve these relationships, use `GetImplicitRolesForUser()` and `GetImplicitPermissionsForUser()` instead of the standard `GetRolesForUser()` and `GetPermissionsForUser()` methods. Additional details are available in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/issues/137).

### 2. Using `BatchEnforce()`

`BatchEnforce()` evaluates multiple access requests simultaneously and returns their results as a boolean array.

For example:

**Go:**
```go
boolArray, err := e.BatchEnforce(requests)
```

**Node.js:**
```typescript
const boolArray = await e.batchEnforce(requests);
```

**Java:**
```java
List<Boolean> boolArray = e.batchEnforce(requests);
```
